Lama State is a meditation tool that interfaces with the NeuroSky headset to collect, analyze, and keep track of brainwave recordings. “Attention” and “Meditation” values range from 0 to 100 and increase when users are focused and relaxed and decrease when they are uneasy or stressed - these values are presented to users in a series of meaningful time-series graphs. Users with a NeuroSky headset will be able to record meditation sessions, compare a session against their past efforts, and even see how well they rank on a collective leaderboard.

The Neurosky MindWave Mobile is an EEG headset, or brain activity monitor. The headset safely detects brainwave signals and is able to interact with the Lama State app.
#### Attention
Attention values range from 0 to 100 and indicate the intensity of mental “focus” or “attention.” The attention level increases when a user focuses on a single thought or an external object, and decreases when distracted.
#### Meditation
Meditation values ranges from 0 to 100 and indicate the level of mental “calmness” or “relaxation.” The meditation level increases when users relax the mind and decreases when they are uneasy or stressed.
